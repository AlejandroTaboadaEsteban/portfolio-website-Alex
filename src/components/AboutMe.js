          <p>
            I was born in 2003 in A Coru√±a and, after finishing High School, in 2021 I moved to Madrid to study the degree of
             Data Science and Engineering in the university Carlos III of Madrid. There I discovered a new world and got very 
            interested about data science. I made projects and learned a lot, and in 2023 I moved to UCR thanks to an international
            exchange program, and I will be here until the end of the academic year. I am planing on ending my degree next May and 
            I am very enthusiastic to enter the world of work of this sector I love. <br/>
            I am a hard-working, creative and proactive person with strong determination and leadership skills, probably due to
            experiences in sport competitions. I also like to practice sport and outdoor activities
