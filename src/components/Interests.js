        <ul>
          <li>I really like practicing sports and physical activities. As a Spaniard, I love soccer, but my favorite sport has 
            always been basketball. I have been playing since I was 7. I have always played in a club and I have been the team captain for 5 years
            . I also like going to the gym or going for a run, or anything that keeps my body in movement and my mind clear.</li>
          <li>I am also a huge fan of traveling, and visiting new places and countries. I think that leaning about a new culture makes 
            you a more intelligent and interesting person, and I enjoy watching the beauty of other places around the world.I translate this interest
             into my desire for learning new languages, that's why I have studied many of them and have English, French and Italian official certificates.
          </li>
          <li>Of course, I am also into programming and data analysis. I am really keen on big data and the ways it can be used to improve
            our world, and the possibilities it brings that have not been explored yet. In fact, I have already closed an internship for 
            this summer at a Spanish company of AI and data analysis, which will allow me to educate myself and learn a lot about this areas.
          </li>
          <li>Also, I am very interested into robotics. In 2017 I got the first place in the WRO Galician Robotics Olympiad, and classified
            for the national competition, where I got the fifth place, getting very close to classifying for the international competition in
             Thailand.
